# Paul-s-Pod-Race
Keep the pod in the air in this simple yet addictive C# game. 
Press the space bar to boost the ship.
Press the N key for an extra big boost. 
See "Assets" folder for the actual scripts I coded to create this game for my daughter's birthday.

P.S. If you're wondering, "Paul" is what my daughter calls her favorite stuffed animal, who looks exactly like the little green guy flying the pod in this game.
